# CourseTrackerCSharp
Course Tracker (Console App) made using C#.
I remade this project in Visual Studios 2019 as a starting project to learn how C# works so as a result, I did not implement a fancy ui component and instead it's just a simple console application.
I found C# to be very similar to Java in a lot of ways so this didn't take me very long to make.
